# pong-with-power-ups
## About
Takes the classic game Pong and adds a twist - power-ups! Enjoy Pong like never before. This game was my first game written in Lua and I wrote it on a plane without any Lua documentation, learning the language's syntax through error messages. The game was also translated to JavaScript for online compatability.

You can try the JavaScript alpha version of this game available here:
