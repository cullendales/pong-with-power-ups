# pong-with-power-ups
## About
Takes the classic game Pong and adds a twist - power-ups! Enjoy Pong like never before. This game was my first game written in Lua and I wrote it on a plane without any Lua documentation, learning the language's syntax through error messages. The game was also translated to JavaScript for online compatability. Currently, the game has 3 power ups. 7 more are currently in development and testing.

You can try the JavaScript alpha version of this game available here:
